A Python script to crawl the online Turkish etymological dictionary, [nisanyansozluk.com](https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/).

## How to Use

1. `pip install nisanyan_crawler`
2. `nisanyan_crawler [first_word] [last_word]`
    - If you want to dump whole database just use, `nisanyan_crawler`.
    - For now _first_ and _last_ words in the dictiorany are _"ab"_ <- -> _"z√ºrriyet"_. These words are used as default in the script.

_Note: Be aware when this code was published. If the site will be updated in the future this code may not work properly._
